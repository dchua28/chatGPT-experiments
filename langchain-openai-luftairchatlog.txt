We are flying Lufthansa premium economy from Charlotte to Munich in Sept. 
Has anyone else flown with them in this class? 
If so can you review the experience. 
I paid $200 extra for each seat from Charlotte to Munich but had to pay $500 extra for each seat on the way home from Munich to Charlotte.
Not sure why this huge disparity but was essentially told by Lufthansa "we do so because we can". 
Thanks for your response in advance....
